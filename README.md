Articial Neural Network.

This repo is dedicated to learn ANN in 4 steps.

- [x] Understand the math
- [x] Develop a prototype inspired by harthur/brain, stevenmiller888/mind and stephencwelch/Neural-Networks-Demystified
- [x] Develop a final and optimized version using nice POO.
- [x] Add extra features as : learningRate, bias node, regulation control.

Coming soon
-----------

- More samples
- Update README to be consistent
- Create a superset of nervous (deep-nervous) to create depp neural networks
